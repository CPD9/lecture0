  <h3>The preson above means so so much to me! Over the past few months we have developed an ever stable and healthy relationship. This is just a little show of appriciation in my own small way for all the joy, laughter and amazing moments she has brought into my life. She is my ray of sunshine even in the most clouded of days. Her presence in my life is my push and source of motivation every single day to be the best I can be for her. I would do anything in my power to ensure her happiness and joy in her life. I pray nothing comes between this relationship 🙏🏾❤️</h3>
